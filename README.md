Have YOU ever wanted to survive in the dangerous, spoopy wilderness?
Have YOU ever wanted to try a game that ISN'T the same as all the rest?
Have YOU ever wanted to download something random from the internet and play it?

If so, this is the game for you!

Harrow: A Survival Simulator is all about strategically managing resources in an unfamiliar environment. You'll explore, find easter eggs, and fight in a boss fight (whOaaa!)

Or tommorow, we aren't picky.

(Note: this game is in ALPHA. It is completely comand-line based [for now]. Expect a GUI version within 1-2 months)
